The lighter's fire lit up the protection of his helmet, the metal was worn and dirty, stained with his own blood, and in the small opening in the helmet, you could see his blue and tired eyes.

He took off the helm as he lighted a cigar between his lips. He took a good puff from the cigar and leaned against the remains of what used to be a wall.

Too much war can tire even an old dog. But Tachanka is not old nor a dog. He is Russian. And there is nothing stronger in the war than a Russian.

*If you aren't russian, you die by a russian.* — It's an old saying that runs on the battlefield. And there is no one more Russian than Tachanka, blonde as the gold, tall as a mountain and robust as a bull.

His weapon has the largest caliber there is, his bullets cannot be stopped, the dead stacking around Tachanka are proof of this, but his armor can be traversed.

— They hit us hard, comrade, but it is not over yet. Are you ready for the next wave?

— Doc, old wolf, how long have you been standing there? Can't you see I'm dying?

Doc, the doctor of the squadron, a man whose precaution makes him an angel on the battlefield, was beside a door's frame without walls, laughing.

Tachanka, the Russian, had five bullets inside of him. His weapon offers the best offensive possible, but it cannot take care of his rear, and that gave enough time for a German to empty a blast of bullets in his back. The wounds were making him lose a lot of blood.

— I have seen, at least, as many men die as the amount you killed. Believe me, the legend is not dying. I think that even if I tried I wouldn't be able to kill you.

With a little help Tachanka got up, closed the helmet's defense and loaded his shotgun.

Hundreds of enemies were trying to enter through what was left of the door and only five worn men would stop them.

And one of those men is a Russian whose legend precedes his bullets, a Russian so hard to kill that people think he is a god, and no one can kill a god because no one can kill Lord Tachanka.

>   There is no man stronger than the Lord, **how could you ever buff a god?**
